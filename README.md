# CSC Hacks 2021

## Project Description
* My goal is to create a basic application that takes advantage of the API provided by Songlink/Odesli. At the moment I am not entirely sure what exactly I want to make, but I expect that to become clearer after I spend some time learning new skills and understand what I am capable of doing.
* I want to do this so I can get experience with (web) app development, which I am totally unexperienced in as of the beginning of CSC Hacks
* Doing this will require learning JavaScript as well as brushing up on my HTML and CSS skills, and probably learning how to use at least another framework or two (so wish me luck!)
* I anticipate me getting very confused in the learning phase and getting a bit stuck on how to use my newly learned skills to make something tangible
